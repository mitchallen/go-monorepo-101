Follow along as I workout the mechanics for my next article on:
* https://scriptable.com/

When the article is finished, I'll post a link in this README.

## Usage

* Clone and then:

```sh
go work init
go work use -r .
go list -f '{{.Dir}}' -m | xargs -L1 go mod tidy -C
go list -f '{{.Dir}}' -m | xargs -L1 go work sync -C
go list -f '{{.Dir}}' -m | xargs -L1 go test -C
```

## Requirements

To use workspace features, this project requires:
* go 18.x or higher

## Steps

### Step 1. Create project folder

* Create a project folder and switch to it:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/projects/golang/go-monorepo-101
cd ~/projects/golang/go-monorepo-101
```

### Step 2. Init workspaces

Initialize the workspace:

```sh
go work init
```

* View the new file that was generated:

```sh
cat go.work
```

### Step 3. Create a library

```sh
mkdir -p ./lib/alpha
cd ./lib/alpha
go mod init alpha
touch alpha.go
touch alpha_test.go
```

* Copy code to alpha.go and alpha_test.go and save them

* Test alpha from within it's directory:

```sh
go test
```

* NOTE: Get this error:
```sh
go: no modules were found in the current workspace; see 'go help work'
```

* Update the workspace (note period at the end for current dir):
```sh
go work use -r . 
```

* Check the go.work file again in the root of the project:
```sh
cat ../../go.work 
```
* Note that alpha is now referenced:
```sh
go 1.21.0

use ./lib/alpha
```

* Try running the tests again (should pass with no issues):
```sh
go test
```

## Step 4. Run tests from root

* If you are still in lib/alpha, back up to the root:

```sh
cd ../..
```

* First tidy up:

```sh
go list -f '{{.Dir}}' -m | xargs -L1 go mod tidy -C
```

* Then go work sync:

```sh
go list -f '{{.Dir}}' -m | xargs -L1 go work sync -C
```

* Finally run the tests:

```sh
go list -f '{{.Dir}}' -m | xargs -L1 go test -C
```

## Step 5. Add .gitignore

* Use VSCode to create a .gitignore file
* Note that it ignores go.work

### Step 6. Create an app module

```sh
mkdir -p ./cmd/demo1
cd ./cmd/demo1
```

* Subsititute my github path for yours:

```sh
go mod init github.com/mitchallen/demo1
```

```sh
touch demo1.go
```

* Use an external dependency

```sh
go get github.com/mitchallen/coin
```

* Add the code for demo1.go

* Try to run the app:

```sh
go run demo1.go
```

* NOTE that you get this error:
```sh
demo1.go:7:2: no required module provides package github.com/mitchallen/coin; to add it:
        go get github.com/mitchallen/coin
```

* Add the module with this commamd (note the dot (.) to indicate the current directory)

```sh
go work use -r .
```

* View the go.work file again:

```sh
cat ../../go.work
```

* Note that the module has now been added to go.work:

```sh
go 1.21.0

use (
        ./cmd/demo1
        ./lib/alpha
)
```

* Run the demo again:

```sh
go run demo1.go
```

* Run the demo again from the root:

```sh
cd ../..
go run ./cmd/demo1/demo1.go
```

* * *
